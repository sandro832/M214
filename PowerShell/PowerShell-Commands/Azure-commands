Azure PowerShell is designed for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line. Use Azure PowerShell when you want to build automated tools that use the Azure Resource Manager model. Try it out in your browser with Azure Cloud Shell, or install on your local machine.

This article helps you get started with Azure PowerShell and teaches the core concepts behind it.
Install or run in Azure Cloud Shell

The easiest way to get started with Azure PowerShell is by trying it out in an Azure Cloud Shell environment. To get up and running with Cloud Shell, see Quickstart for PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell runs PowerShell on a Linux container, so Windows-specific functionality isn't available.

When you're ready to install Azure PowerShell on your local machine, follow the instructions in Install the Azure PowerShell module.
Sign in to Azure

Sign in interactively with the Connect-AzAccount cmdlet. Skip this step if you use Cloud Shell. Your Azure Cloud Shell session is already authenticated for the environment, subscription, and tenant that launched the Cloud Shell session.

Connect-AzAccount

Azure cloud services offer environments compliant with regional data-handling laws. For accounts in a regional cloud, use the Environment parameter to sign in. Get the name of the environment for your region using the Get-AzEnvironment cmdlet. For example, to sign in to Azure China 21Vianet:
Azure PowerShell

Connect-AzAccount -Environment AzureChinaCloud

In Windows PowerShell 5.1 environments, you'll receive a sign-in dialog to provide a username and password for your Azure account. On every other version of PowerShell, you'll get a token to use on microsoft.com/devicelogin. Open this page in your browser and enter the token, then sign in with your Azure account credentials and authorize Azure PowerShell.

After signing in, you'll see information indicating which of your Azure subscriptions is active. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions in your account and want to select a different one, get your available subscriptions with Get-AzSubscription and use the Set-AzContext cmdlet with your subscription ID. For more information about managing your Azure subscriptions in Azure PowerShell, see Use multiple Azure subscriptions.

Once signed in, use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets to access and manage resources in your subscription. To learn more about the sign-in process and authentication methods, see Sign in with Azure PowerShell.
Find commands

Azure PowerShell cmdlets follow a standard naming convention for PowerShell, Verb-Noun. The verb describes the action (examples include New, Get, Set, Remove) and the noun describes the resource type (examples include AzVM, AzKeyVaultCertificate, AzFirewall, AzVirtualNetworkGateway). Nouns in Azure PowerShell always start with the prefix Az. For the full list of standard verbs, see Approved verbs for PowerShell Commands.

Knowing the nouns, verbs, and the Azure PowerShell modules available helps you find commands with the Get-Command cmdlet. For example, to find all VM-related commands that use the Get verb:
PowerShell

Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun AzVM* -Module Az.Compute

To help you find common commands, this table lists the resource type, corresponding Azure PowerShell module, and noun prefix to use with Get-Command:
Find commands
Resource type 	Azure PowerShell module 	Noun prefix
Resource group 	Az.Resources 	AzResourceGroup
Virtual machines 	Az.Compute 	AzVM
Storage accounts 	Az.Storage 	AzStorageAccount
Key Vault 	Az.KeyVault 	AzKeyVault
Web applications 	Az.Websites 	AzWebApp
SQL databases 	Az.Sql 	AzSqlDatabase

For a full list of the modules in Azure PowerShell, see the Azure PowerShell modules list hosted on GitHub.
Telemetry

Azure PowerShell automatically collects telemetry data by default. Microsoft aggregates collected data to identify patterns of usage, to identify common issues, and to improve the experience of Azure PowerShell. Microsoft Azure PowerShell doesn't collect any private or personal data. To disable data collection, you must explicitly opt out by executing Disable-AzDataCollection.
